# af2_pocketcys

something to consider:

too long protein has multiple AF2 files F1, F2... each one with 1400 aa



a domain can be non-continuous

```
[{"start":2901,"end":3024,"dc-status":"C_TERMINAL_DISC"},{"start":3056,"end":3201,"dc-status":"N_TERMINAL_DISC"}]

```



some protein in ssf database are not in human AF proteome (e.g. Q9YNA8). May need call `request` for these.
